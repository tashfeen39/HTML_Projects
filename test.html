      Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, material world or
      universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and
      also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only,
      part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is
      often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.The
      word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the
      Latin word natura, or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in
      ancient times, literally meant "birth".[2] In ancient philosophy, natura
      is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις),
      which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants,
      animals, and other features of the world develop of their own
      accord.[3][4] The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is
      one of several expansions of the original notion;[1] it began with certain
      core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers (though
      this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and
      has steadily gained currency ever since. During the advent of modern
      scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive
      reality, organized and moved by divine laws.[5][6] With the Industrial
      revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality
      deprived from intentional intervention: it was hence considered as sacred
      by some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere
      decorum for divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx). However, a
      vitalist vision of nature, closer to the presocratic one, got reborn at
      the same time, especially after Charles Darwin.

      Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to
      geology and wildlife. Nature can refer to the general realm of living
      plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with
      inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change
      of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth. It is
      often taken to mean the "natural environment" or wilderness—wild animals,
      rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been
      substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite
      human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human
      interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified
      as, for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature". This more
      traditional concept of natural things that can still be found today
      implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the
      artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a
      human consciousness or a human mind. Depending on the particular context,
      the term "natural" might also be distinguished from the unnatural or the
      supernatural.

      Earth is the only planet known to support life, and its natural features
      are the subject of many fields of scientific research. Within the solar
      system, it is third closest to the sun; it is the largest terrestrial
      planet and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic features
      are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow temperate zones,
      and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region.[7] Precipitation
      varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less
      than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by
      salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents and islands, with
      most of the inhabited land in the Northern Hemisphere. Earth has evolved
      through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the
      original conditions. The outer surface is divided into several gradually
      migrating tectonic plates. The interior remains active, with a thick layer
      of plastic mantle and an iron-filled core that generates a magnetic field.
      This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer
      phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through
      dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.

      The Earth's atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the ecosystem. The
      thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by gravity.
      Air is mostly nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, with much smaller amounts of
      carbon dioxide, argon, etc. The atmospheric pressure declines steadily
      with altitude. The ozone layer plays an important role in depleting the
      amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As DNA is
      readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface.
      The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the
      daily temperature extremes. Terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively
      in the lower part of the atmosphere, and serves as a convective system for
      redistributing heat.[26] Ocean currents are another important factor in
      determining climate, particularly the major underwater thermohaline
      circulation which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to
      the polar regions. These currents help to moderate the differences in
      temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones. Also,
      without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and
      atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the polar regions much
      colder.
